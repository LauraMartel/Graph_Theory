# Data analysis
- The project: Graph_Theory with the help of A.I.
- Description: I used chatGPT to calculates the distance between
European cities, plots the graph of the distance between different
European cities, and customize the appearance of the graph.
- There are two files one with the coordinates and one with the class in the Graph_Theory folder.
